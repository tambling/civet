A civet is a smaller relative of the mongoose. Similarly, Civet is a smaller
relative of Mongoose, as in it's a small, lightweight ORM that exposes some of
the same methods as Mongoose, especially as relate to collection-level CRUD.

## Why is Civet?
Civet exists because it can be useful to play around with Express without first
learning all of the ins and outs of Mongo and Mongoose. Sometimes you just want
to be able to get started quickly, store your records in memory, and worry about
persistence later.

Specifically, this was put together as a sort of "training lightsaber" for the
younglings in General Assembly's Web Development Intensive. _Hi, WDI DTLA 6!_
